      hazardous. Many 
      chimneys will not be made 
      with individuals mind, so be 
      safe when taking place your 
      chimney. Dress in footwear with rubber bottoms to stop 
      dropping. Additionally, use a utilize if

      boot styles. These footwear are living at the 
      chimney fence, plus they 
      tend to dry up. When this occurs, they 
      become susceptible to seepage, so don't 
      overlook to
