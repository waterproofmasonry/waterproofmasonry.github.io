      established. Companies who 
      definitely have been doing work for 
      years and also have a great

      they tell you is most probably 
      dependable. Also, providing you 
      with a typed 
      price is yet another sign of a real 
      professional. You would 
      like these qualities 
      within your chimneying

      speak to loved 
      ones, close friends and 
      neighbours that 
      may have 
      appointed a person in the past. 
      Ask a lot of questions about the companies
